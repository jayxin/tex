% I wrote a beamer template for MedStar Health presentations. %% 
%% An example of how the slides would look is provided in example.tex %%%%%%%% 

%%% I generated a separate style file (MedStarColors) %%% The user should download it as well as the .cls file
%%%% % This is a helpful website: http://www.r-bloggers.com/create-your-own-beamer-template/
% More information on colors available here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Presentations

%%% The beamer themes info lines and mini frames were useful resources to work off of though others can also be used %%% 
%%% The two files (MedStarColors) and medstarbeamer.cls contain helpful comments to guide the user %%%
