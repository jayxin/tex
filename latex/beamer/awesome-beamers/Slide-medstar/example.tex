\section{The Problem of Interest}
\begin{frame}{Dataset}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The dataset used was from ``Survival Analysis - Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data".} 
\item{It was a hypothetical study of the mortality experience of diabetics.}
\item{30 diabetics were followed till death or the end of the study.}
\item{The subject's age at entry into the study and the age at the end of the study or death were recorded.}
\item{Rather than time to event analysis, I was interested in how ``entry age" and ``exit age", affected survival.} 
\item{\alert{The response variable, survival, was binary (=1 if alive, =0 if dead).}}
\end{enumerate}
